------------------------------------For floating-point numbers------------------------------------
First case:
X is float and compared to the literal 3.425 which is considered a double, thus, the condition (X == 3.425) evaluates to false
They are NOT Equal!

Second case:
X is float and compared to the literal 3.425f which is considered a float, thus, the condition (X == 3.425) evaluates to true
They are Equal!

Third case:
Y is double and compared to the literal 3.425 which is considered a double, thus, the condition (Y == 3.425) evaluates to true
They are Equal!

Fourth case:
Z is float and compared to the literal 0.5 which is considered a double but its representation is the same as a float or a double, thus, the condition (Z == 0.5) evaluates to true
They are Equal!
